# Movie Recommender

A small movie recommendation project. This repository contains code to preprocess data, train a recommender model, and run a simple application (entrypoint: `app.py`). The project includes scripts for data preprocessing, training, Kafka consumption, and utilities.

## What this repo contains

- `app.py` — project entrypoint / application.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used by the project.
- `assets/` — static assets (images, icons, etc.).
- `data/` — datasets and slices used for training or evaluation.
- `docs/` — documentation and notes.
- `scripts/` — helpful scripts:
  - `analysis.py`
  - `kafka_consumer.py`
  - `preprocess_and_train.py`
- `utils/` — utility helper functions.

## Key features

- Data preprocessing and training tooling
- Kafka consumer example for streaming data
- Simple app to demonstrate recommendations

## Prerequisites

- Windows (PowerShell used in examples below)
- Python 3.8+ (use your environment manager of choice)
- Git

## Dependencies

The project's dependencies (from `requirements.txt`):

- streamlit
- kafka-python==2.0.2
- pyspark
- delta-spark
- redis
- pandas
- pyarrow

Install them with the command shown in the Quick start section.

## Quick start (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in the project root (where `app.py` sits) and run:

```powershell
# create a venv
python -m venv .venv
# activate venv (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# upgrade pip and install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

- If `app.py` is a standard Python script / Flask/FastAPI entrypoint:

```powershell
python app.py
```

- If the app is a Streamlit app (the project includes `streamlit` in `requirements.txt`):

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Adjust the command above according to the framework used inside `app.py`.

## Project layout (brief)

- `scripts/preprocess_and_train.py` — run data preprocessing and training pipeline.
- `scripts/kafka_consumer.py` — example Kafka consumer that shows how streaming input can be consumed.
- `utils/` — helper modules used by scripts and app.

## Assumptions

- `app.py` is intended as the runtime entrypoint. If your actual entrypoint differs (for example `webapp.py` or `src/main.py`), update the README accordingly.
- `requirements.txt` is present and accurate. If you add or remove libraries, update `requirements.txt` and this README.

## Tests

No automated tests are included by default. Adding a small test suite (pytest) is recommended for future work.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a branch for your feature or fix.
2. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

## License

No license specified. If you want to make this project public for reuse, consider adding a `LICENSE` file (MIT or Apache-2.0 are commonly used).

## Contact

For questions about this repo, update the README or open an issue.

---

If you want, I can also:
- Add a minimal `README` badge or project logo.
- Detect the exact framework inside `app.py` and tailor the run instructions (I can inspect `app.py` now if you want).
- Add a `Makefile` or PowerShell script to automate setup.

Assumptions made: `app.py` is the entrypoint; `requirements.txt` lists the required dependencies. If those are incorrect, tell me and I will adapt the README accordingly.
